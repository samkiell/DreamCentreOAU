PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

Senator Oluremi Tinubu Dream Centre Website

1. Project Overview

This project is the official website for the Senator Oluremi Tinubu Dream Centre located at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife.

The website is designed as a calm, reflective, and dignified digital extension of the physical space. Its primary role is to communicate philosophy, purpose, and atmosphere, not to market programs or solicit action.

The site must feel like a quiet walk into the building itself.

2. Core Intent

The website exists to:

• Preserve the narrative and philosophy of the Dream Centre
• Communicate its purpose clearly and truthfully
• Reflect the emotional and architectural aura of the space
• Serve as a foundation for future content such as stories, events, or reflections

It must never exaggerate, speculate, or invent.

3. What This Website Is Not

This website is not:

• A startup landing page
• A political campaign asset
• A donation or fundraising platform
• A skills acquisition or bootcamp site
• A news blog filled with frequent updates

Any future expansion must respect the original tone and intent.

4. Audience Definition

Primary audience:
• Students of Obafemi Awolowo University

Secondary audience:
• Academic visitors
• Institutional partners
• Members of the public seeking understanding, not enrollment

The language must remain accessible, calm, and respectful.

5. Tone and Voice Rules

Mandatory tone characteristics:

• Reflective
• Warm
• Quietly confident
• Grounded
• Respectful

Strict prohibitions:

• No hype language
• No exaggerated empowerment claims
• No marketing slogans
• No startup jargon
• No political messaging

Copy should feel like thoughtful narration, not persuasion.

6. Visual and Emotional Direction

The website should visually communicate:

• Warmth without brightness
• Calm without emptiness
• Elegance without luxury excess
• Institutional dignity without stiffness

Design principles:

• Avoid pure white backgrounds
• Use warm off white, stone, sand, soft earth tones
• Allow generous spacing and breathing room
• Prefer depth, shadow, and texture over contrast
• Let images of the building lead the emotion

The site should feel cozy, intentional, and human.

7. Technology Stack

Core stack:

• Next.js using App Router
• TypeScript
• Modern CSS solution suitable for design systems
• Optimized image handling
• Static first, dynamic ready

The architecture must support future growth without rewriting foundations.

8. Content Architecture

Initial version is a single page experience with the following conceptual sections:

Arrival
A quiet hero section that sets mood before explanation.

The Dream Centre
Clear explanation of what the centre is and why it exists.

Philosophy and Vision
The heart of the site. Focus on reflection, patience, discipline, and purpose.

The Space
Visual storytelling through architecture and interior imagery.

Legacy and Stakeholders
Presentation of contributors with respect and restraint.

Location and Access
Clear factual location and intended audience.

No section should feel rushed or crowded.

9. Content Integrity Rules

Every statement must be backed by confirmed research.

Explicitly forbidden:

• Invented programs
• Promised timelines
• Assumed future initiatives
• Generic inspirational filler

If information is unavailable, it should be omitted, not guessed.

10. Future Evolution Strategy

The site is expected to evolve into a dynamic platform over time.

Potential future additions may include:

• Stories and reflections
• Event announcements
• Archival content
• Digital storytelling elements

Current architecture must allow:

• Incremental expansion
• Content driven growth
• No tone break between versions

Future features must extend the original philosophy, not replace it.

11. Design and Engineering Philosophy

This project prioritizes:

• Clarity over cleverness
• Calm over stimulation
• Meaning over metrics
• Longevity over trends

If a design or feature does not deepen understanding or atmosphere, it does not belong.
